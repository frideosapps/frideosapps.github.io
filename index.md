### Flutter examples

Here the links to some of the example apps I built with Flutter in the last months.

-   [Booktrailer](http://frideosapps.github.io/booktrailer): an experimental book trailer for my novel, built with Flutter web –[repository](https://github.com/frideosapps/booktrailer).
-   [Starfield](https://frideosapps.github.io/flutter_starfield): a simple and “old” starfield (do you remember Windows 95? :-)) –  [repository](https://github.com/frideosapps/flutter_starfield)
-   [Calcolatore Child-Pugh](https://github.com/frideosapps/childpugh)  (in the repo you can see thee branches, the "master" one is the app made with classic BLoC pattern, then two braches forse frideos package and rebuilder versions).
-   [Classificazione pressione arteriosa](https://github.com/frideosapps/bloodpressure)
-   Quiz game ([frideos package version](https://github.com/frideosapps/trivia_example), [rebuilder package version](https://github.com/frideosapps/trivia_rebuilder))
-   [Pair game](https://github.com/frideosapps/pair_game)

### Package per Dart & Flutter

I made the following packages:

-   [Frideos](https://pub.dev/packages/frideos): helpers for state management, streams and BLoC pattern, animations, blur, transitions, timed widgets, scrollingtext, etc.
-   [Frideos-light](https://pub.dev/packages/frideos_light): the frideos package without the SharedPreferences dependency.
-   [Frideos-core](https://pub.dev/packages/frideos_core): core package used from the frideos and frideos light packages.
-   [Rebuilder](https://pub.dev/packages/rebuilder): an easy and minimalistic state management library for flutter.
-   [Frideos-kvprx](https://pub.dev/packages/frideos_kvprx): a library that offers persistent and reactive classes, and helpers to easily store key/value pairs in the database, using the sqflite plugin.
